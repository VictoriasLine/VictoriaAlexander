#### Project Goal 

A few months ago I met with a local artist who was a family friend. She mentioned that she was wanting to set up a
website for her artwork where she could sell prints but she did not know how.
At the time I did not know how to begin to make a website. She knew I was taking classes in computer science and asked that when I
get to website development in my studies that I reach out.
I really enjoyed week 8 and 9 problem sets. It was these assignments that gave me the cofidence to chose Victoria's Art Show as my
final project.

#### How it all came together 

We had previously used bootstrap in class and I set out to learn more regaurding bootstrap on https://www.w3schools.com/bootstrap/bootstrap_ver.asp
It was there that I learned W3 had their own css framework. I had not specifically enjoyed using bootstrap and I didnt want to
use a template for my website lay out. Instead I wanted to design the layout my self.
I completed the tutorial on W3.css and began desining the website.
To start I completed a webpage demo to show to Victoria so that she might have an idea of what her page could look like.
This demo page was called Monica's Art which can be viewed here https://mxw035.github.io/Monica-s-Art/

##### Design 

My design:
- [x] Homepage
- [x] About the artist
- [x] Art Gallary
- [x] Inspiration behind the art: This idea was not possible because of the vast amount of art work that Victoria had and that she often does not remeber the 
 inspirations for her pieces.
- [x] Contact page
- [x] Next show
- [x] Ordering prints
- [x] Request custom art
- [x] Vicotira was really excited about also show caseing other local artists on the page as guests
- [x] Video page that would link to a youtube account where Victoria or Guests could film and share their process. 
- [x] requests for video topics

##### Files 

Because I was using Github pages for the website it needed to be a static webpage and all files would be in the same folder. There were 22 html files needed for the website. 70 jpg files that were Victoria's orginal work. 19jpg files for the guest artist section. As well as 12 other jpg files that were used throughout the webpage. 
There were more html files that orginally planned because along side creating her website Victoria also asked me to manage and help create products as well as helping to book public apperances. 
Most pages either started from the basic layout.html or slideshow.html. 
The files are as followed.
